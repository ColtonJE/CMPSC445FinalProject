# CMPSC445FinalProject
This is our text sentiment analysis machine learning project. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create the webpage. Python was used to create the webserver and handle the machine learning text sentiment analysis.

### Instructions
1. Start the server by running app.py
2. Log into the server by typing localhost:5000 into any browser
3. Enter a tweet URL into the text box
4. Click enter (Note: The text sentiment analysis will not work unless you have a TwitterAPI key in a file called license.txt)
